                    <p>My name is Malin and I'm a breathwork facilitator and vinyasa yoga teacher in Gothenburg, Sweden. In the hustling and bustling world of today we all need to find a way to de-stress and ground
                        ourselves. For me, that means to turn to breathwork and yoga.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>I remember my first encounter with yoga back in early 2000. I was reading about some movements in a health magazine that
                        was called yoga and I tried to do them on the rug in my living room. Little did I know then what part yoga would play in
                        my life.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>On this site you'll find information on what breathwork and vinyasa, the yoga branch I teach, are. You can also <a href="classes.html">book</a> classes and sign up for my newsletter.</p>

            <h3>Testimonials</h3>
            <div id="testimonial-1">
                <p> <cite>I have attended several breathwork sessions with Malin and am amazed by how different experiences I have had each time
                    and by the healing effects and also the deeper understanding that breathwork provides of where I am at and what I need
                    to attend to. I can highly recommend Malin's sessions and the way she guides her participants through the sessions. I
                    always feel safe, held, challenged (in a good way) and supported in her sessions.</cite></p>

                <p> <cite>I can really recommend Yoga with Malin! She is truly one of the most inspiring women I've ever met and that translates
                    into her practice and guidance. Her teaching has a very grounding effect and you feel safe and seen all throughout the
                    practice and beyond! Wish I lived in Sweden so I could take her classes regularly, but am looking forward to practice
                    with her again in the future!</cite></p>
